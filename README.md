# Web Development Log

This repository documents my journey in **web development**, from refreshing HTML/CSS basics to mastering **full-stack development, JavaScript frameworks, and web security**. 

It also serves as a **dev journal**, showing my learning process, experiments, and projects over time. The goal is to build a portfolio that demonstrates both **technical skills and continuous learning**.

## About Me

I am a **Full-Stack Developer** with experience in React, .NET, SQL, HTML, CSS, and more. I combine technical skills with leadership, creative problem-solving, and a disciplined work ethic honed from my time as a U.S. Army NCO.
